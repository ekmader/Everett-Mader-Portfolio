 This collapsible plywood chair was designed with portability and simplicity in mind. 
      Inspired by molded plywood forms, it functions as both a practical travel chair and an exploration of joinery without hardware.      </p>

          <h2>Design Details</h2>
          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>On the first day of my furniture design
class in Copenhagen my professor set
the challenge to construct a shell chair ,
a piece of furniture traditionally built
from a single, continuous piece of
pressed plywood.</p>
</p>I asked what former students did with
their chairs at the end of the semester .
He replied that most of them disposed
of , donated, or shipped them home.
Rather than accepting the typical
outcomes I set a personal design
challenge: the chair needed to fit in my
duffle bag.</p>

          <h2>The Process</h2>
          <p>Through multiple iterations I developed a t-tab
cutout system that allowed the backrest to
release from the seat and reconnect through
gravity , pressure and magnets, combined with
articulating legs that folded flush beneath the
seat.
The final chair balanced portability , structural
integrity , and comfort, folding in under a minute,
yet sturdy for daily use.
During the final critique, my professor noted it
was the first fully portable shell chair produced in
the course. It confirmed for me that innovation
often begins with questioning what everyone else
accepts as given.</p>
