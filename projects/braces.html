          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>When I first became interested in architecture, one of my professors told me that before I could design buildings, I should learn how they’re made. That advice led me to Scratch Builders, a specialty frame wood shop in Vermont known for doing everything in-house, from design drawings to raising the last frame.</p>
          <p>I joined as a carpenter to learn what drawings cannot teach, like how Douglass Fir does not consider your feelings when it splinters through a finger, or the degree of coordination and trust that is required to make something stand. For one house my main role was to measure, cut, and finish thirty-four timber braces for a frame that would be installed in the course of a few days.</p>

        <div class="gallery-text">
          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>Each brace began as a twelve-foot beam of milled Douglass Fir (or Douggy Fresh as we called it). I learned how to translate a set of construction drawings into accurate layout lines, and how to use the appropriate hand and power tools to cut mortise and tenon joints that would fit perfectly with the rest of the frame once everything came together.</p>
          <p>Most days were spent in the shop with our crew of seven (including our two shop dogs Honey and Peluci). We worked in synchrony with each other, checking each other’s measurements and helping to move massive pieces between saw horses. The work demanded focus and communication. If one cut was off by an eighth of an inch, it affected everyone.</p>
          <p>The process made collaboration physical. Each cut depended on another person’s accuracy and every decision had a consequence somewhere else in the frame. I began to learn how interdependent projects work and how shared accountability maintains balance.</p>

          <h2>Outcome</h2>
          <p>When we raised the frame, all the posts, beams, and braces fit as planned. Joining each piece confirmed what I had been learning for weeks. Precision and timing  are the product of thoughtful actions and planning. It all came together because each of us was meticulous and aware of our limits. We never hesitated to ask for an extra set of hands or a second opinion.</p>
          <p>That experience taught me to recognize that  structure is literally the fruit of collaboration.</p>
          <p>I began to see how consistency builds reliability, and how attention at every stage supports the integrity of the whole. Timber framing shaped how I now approach problem solving.</p>
          <p>The idiom “measure twice, cut once” still guides me, not just in crafting, but in how I plan, test, and deliver.</p>
