          <h2>Site Challenge</h2>
          <p>The site along Copenhagen’s lakes is one of the city’s most trafficked, yet underutilized spaces. Historically defined by transit as a place you’d pass through on your bike,  it offered little reason to pause, gather, or reflect.</p>
          <p>The design brief called for a café. But to me, that felt reductive. Copenhagen is already known for it’s award winning cafés; another one wouldn’t mean much. The real challenge was:</p>
          <p>How might we transform a space of passage into a site of presence? How could a single program become a catalyst for connection between people, food, and environment?</p>

          <h2>Choreographed Experience</h2>
          <p>I designed this project as a journey through three distinct spatial experiences: intimacy, immersion, and reconnection. Each is intended to shift how people feel, behave, and relate to their physical environment.</p>

          <h2>Immersion in Growth</h2>
          <p>Connected to this is a three-story greenhouse, which invites visitors into a vertical ecosystem, creating an immersive and unexpected rendezvous with nature in the middle of the city. This greenhouse not only serves as a dramatic spatial gesture, but also as a working system for food production and biodiversity.</p>

          <p>The experience opens onn the rooftop terrace where outdoor seating reconnects guests with the surrounding environment.</p>
          <p>Sustainability was not a checklist, but a system: material reuse, localized food growth, and natural climate strategies built into the architecture itself.</p>

          <h2>Reframing What a Café Can Be</h2>
          <p>This project provoked conversation about how everyday typologies, like a café can be reimagined as catalysts for perspective shifts and connection. Professors, architects, and peers responded not to the form alone, but to the reframing of the program away from consumption to cultivation.</p>
          <p>For me, this project was personal. Having worked in kitchens and fine dining, I’ve contributed to the magic  that atmosphere, intentionality, and food are capable of.  It is astounding how purposeful experiential leadership can foster care, culture, and community. This project showed me how spatial design can extend that meaning, how  space is the medium for people to nourish ecological awareness and social connection.</p>
