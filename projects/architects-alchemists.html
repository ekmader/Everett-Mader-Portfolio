Where do old bricks go when buildings are deconstructed? Brick heaven… brick hell? Typically they’re simply crushed and repurposed for asphalt. While filling holes is more of a second life than many materials get, it’s still rather underwhelming for the energy expended to construct bricks. Thelma Slaato and Cecilie Morsbøl, the golden-haired architects, agree. Their stylish matching black t-shirts tucked into pinstripe suit pants are misleading. You might mistake them simply as fashionable designers instead of the truth— fashionable alchemists. two of them have spent the last year and a half experimenting with the lifecycle of bricks. Far from purgatory, their work offers a new afterlife for construction’s humble materials.Alchemy is the practice of the transmutation of matter, it is largely considered to be the antecedent to modern chemistry, although that’s not to say there aren’t a handful of alchemists still at work today. The auricomous duo are conducting laborious research on the properties of stone to see how they can reincorporate old masonry into new projects— the alchemy of stone. The omnipresent kernel of their work is collaboration. They’ve tirelessly labored in Prøvestenen (the artificial island off the northeast coast of Amager) not only cleaning old bricks, but reimagining what form old stone can take in a new life. On their site in Prøvestenen grey is the preeminent color and motley construction noises are the song. Under the mentorship of their dear mason, Max (his name is Max and he is a mason by trade) they’ve cultivated not only impressive abilities working with stone cutting devices, but also a profound relationship. 
Globally, brick waste accounts for 50-70% of construction waste generated in urban redevelopment (Al-Fakih, et al., 2019). On the subject of brickwork Thelma’s sigh was the elected representative for days of labor and exhaustion, sharing that bricks held together with lime mortar, opposed to cement, are amazingly painless to repurpose. If lime mortar is van-der Waals bond, cement is covalent. Lime mortar is considerably softer and more flexible than cement mortar, so when buildings erected with lime mortar are being dismantled the mortar crumbles away, leaving the bricks and stones undamaged and available for reuse. In contrast, cement sets remarkably hard. When masonry bonded with cement is dismantled the bricks and stones are typically broken or chipped, reducing or eliminating their structural reuse potential altogether. 
Oh, but both mortars are merely construction waste when they’re broken down right? 
Well, sort of. 
Cement mortar rubble certainly has limited reuse options, typically it’s downcycled as aggregate for road base, but can’t be restored into a binding material. On the other hand, when lime mortar is broken down it is simply calcium carbonate, which is rather benign. Calcium carbonate can be recycled back into new lime mortar (with some extra required energy to reconvert it to calcium oxide otherwise known as quicklime). Lime mortar seems to be a valuable player in the circular use of materials, enabling generations of life for bricks and stone, while cement mortar seems to only devalue these materials. 
In their tenure handling these materials they’ve discovered and invented beauty from heaps of miscellaneous stone. When cross sectioned, cement reveals beautiful terrazzo patterns from its aggregates, which they’ve brought to the facade of the MiniCO2 Floor House BETON spearheaded by the architecture firm CEBRA. At the time of their partnership their resculpted cement hadn’t actually been structurally implemented anywhere yet, so they developed a prototype for the wall they developed. It’s a remarkable display of craftsmanship and commitment to their purpose. They are tinkerers at their core and seek to ensure a strong delivery of their mission in their projects.   
And what about those pesky perforated bricks, how can those be reused? Slaatto and Morsbøl developed a method of splitting the bricks lengthwise, revealing the raw, unburnt clay, and drawing attention to the distinct patterns formed by the original perforations in each brick. These bricks are then bound with a shallow pool of lime mortar, once set an ornamental, tile-esque pattern is revealed. They’ve implemented this technique for the interior flooring of a client’s home. Exposing the inside of a brick you reveal the unburnt clay, which is softer and significantly more porous than the burnt side. So by having floors made of it homes are cooler in the summer, warmer in the winter, and they absorb more moisture. By using locally sourced resources for their projects they’re able to embrace Scandinavian design and contribute to timeless projects, an increasingly important quality of sustainable design. If a building is timeless it won’t be ripped down when it goes out of style.  
It should be noted that Max isn’t the only friend they’ve made along their journey. They’ve joined forces with LH Hockerup, a demolition team in Copenhagen, who shoots them a call when they have usable resources they’ve stripped from their client’s developments. A recent example of this was their reuse of the cement facades from Bellahøj, Denmark’s first highrise buildings. They revitalized the cement slabs as the new facade of Hal Sct. Clara Molle, a new recycling hall in Roskilde. The project will serve as a timber warehouse and be a display construction through recycled materials. 
Through their collaboration with LH Hockerup they’ve found a gap in the building industry. There aren’t warehouses for storing used materials, they simply get discarded. This observation exposes a critical shortfall within the industry: the absence of proper facilities to store and repurpose reclaimed materials leaves designers and builders without the necessary resources to engage in sustainable construction practices. 
The pair have completely flipped the architectural process they learned in school on its head. Due to the nature of their relationship with forward thinking folks like the team at LH Hockerup and their clients they improvise their design procedure, working with whatever recycled materials become available to them along the way. This method reconsiders the conventional architectural process, which customarily requires architects to develop neatly polished plans and drafts before any construction begins. 
It should be noted that these two have only recently entered the practice of architecture. They’re still figuring out their trajectories, but have found a beautiful purpose in their efforts. They suggest that architects shouldn’t be driven by glamorous lives seen by the rock-starchitects  of the 20th century. Instead, contemporary architects should be motivated  by paving a new era of design, perhaps a retort to decades of building with a “sky's the limit” attitude presented by renowned groups like the Bjarke Ingels Group. In response to a funding related question Thelma chuckled with a grin, “your expectations for food dramatically decrease.”
