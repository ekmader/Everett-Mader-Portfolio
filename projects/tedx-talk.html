          <h2>What Happened?</h2>
            <p>I was selected to speak at UVM’s (University of Vermont) official TEDx event, which invited students to share personal perspectives on sustainability.  I structured my talk around my previous Architects or Alchemists essay, emphasizing reuse and calling attention towards the way the built environment shapes the way we live.</p>
            <p>I grew up in Manhattan, where every experience is themed by buildings. Over time, I became curious about how architecture influences behavior and cognition. That curiosity followed me to the University of Vermont, where I studied neuroscience, then later into carpentry, and eventually into architectural research. This talk became a way to connect those paths.</p>
            <p>I structured the talk around stories rather than arguments. I opened with the High Line, a structure once considered obsolete, and traced how it became a public space through collective imagination. From there, I shared my experience learning timber framing, where materials are handled directly and choices carry immediate consequences. I closed with the work of architects in Copenhagen who design with reclaimed bricks and demolition waste, treating sustainability not as a trend but as a relationship with what already exists.</p>
            <p>The talk was grounded in my personal experiences. I wanted the audience to leave not with a list of solutions, but with a shift in perspective. Sustainability, to me, is less about creating something new and more about recognizing value where others see excess.</p>
            <p>Altogether this experience reinforced the  power of storytelling for me. Preparing and delivering this talk helped me understand that insights aren’t just about knowing more, they’re about being able to juggle complexity and nuance between industries and individual perspectives.</p>
